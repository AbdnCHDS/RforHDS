# Introduction to R and the Tidyverse

Dimitra Blana and Jess Butler, Thursday Dec 5th 2019

Based on online material from Amy Willis, Kiirsti Owen and Amelia McNamara, and the book “R for Data Science” by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. The “R for Data Science” book is available for free online: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/

**Workshop objective**: To give participants the confidence to find out how to do data analysis in R

**Specific aims**: Learn how to

1. load data
2. transform and summarise data
3. make plots  

The R script used during the workshop is [R_tidyverse_workshop.R](https://github.com/AbdnCHDS/RforHDS/blob/master/Intro_R_Tidyverse/R_tidyverse_workshop.R). An R Markdown version is provided as well ([R_tidyverse_workshop.Rmd](https://github.com/AbdnCHDS/RforHDS/blob/master/Intro_R_Tidyverse/R_tidyverse_workshop.Rmd)) for participants who are more advanced R users.

For the hands-on exercises, we use blue and yellow sticky notes given to the participants to make it easy to see who needs help, and when to move on:

- No sticky note on the monitor means people are happily working on the assignment
- Blue sticky note means they are finished
- Yellow sticky note means they are stuck and could use some help

The rough schedule for the workshop is:

|               |                           |
