### Some thoughts following the first workshop

Dimitra:

- Timing of intro / reading in data / manipulating data was about right
- Plotting took less time - could add a few exercises to that section
- Case study: should provide a bit more direction and hints to help people work through it
- Do the entire workshop in R markdown

From the participants (anonymous feedback):

- Longer introduction to R markdown
- Display the relevant cheat sheet on the screen (this requires a larger room)
- More practical exercises
- Short homework containing very basic things, which can be discussed in the next meeting
