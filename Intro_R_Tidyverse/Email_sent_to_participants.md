We will start at 9:30 with drinks/snacks and making sure everyone’s laptop has the required software. We will have hot water, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, etc. and we do have some mugs, but please bring one if you remember so we have enough for everyone.

We will finish by 16:30 at the latest, and we’ll have many breaks for refuelling, including a lunch break (but unfortunately we won’t be able to provide lunch).

This is the software we will need, if you’d like to install it before the workshop:

- A recent version of R (3.6.1), available for free at: https://cran.r-project.org/
- A recent version of RStudio IDE (1.2.5019), available for free at: www.rstudio.com/download

Please remember your power supply! I look forward to seeing you there.
