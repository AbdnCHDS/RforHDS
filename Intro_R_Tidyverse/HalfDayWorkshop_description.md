# Introduction to R and the Tidyverse

Dimitra Blana, Monday Jan 6th 2020

Based on online material from Amy Willis, Kiirsti Owen and Amelia McNamara, and the book “R for Data Science” by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. The “R for Data Science” book is available for free online: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/

**Workshop objective**: To give participants the confidence to find out how to do data analysis in R

**Specific aims**: Learn how to

1. load data
2. transform and summarise data  

The R Markdown file used during the workshop is [R_tidyverse_workshop.Rmd](https://github.com/AbdnCHDS/RforHDS/blob/master/Intro_R_Tidyverse/R_tidyverse_workshop.Rmd).
We also have an R script version ([R_tidyverse_workshop.R](https://github.com/AbdnCHDS/RforHDS/blob/master/Intro_R_Tidyverse/R_tidyverse_workshop.R)). The file contains material on plotting as well, but we will not cover this during the half-day workshop.

For the hands-on exercises, we use blue and yellow sticky notes given to the participants to make it easy to see who needs help, and when to move on:

- No sticky note on the monitor means people are happily working on the assignment
- Blue sticky note means they are finished
- Yellow sticky note means they are stuck and could use some help

The rough schedule for the workshop is:

|               |                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| 9:30 - 11:00 | Intro and reading in data |
| 11:00 - 11:15 | Break |
| 11:15 - 12:30 | Transforming and summarising data |
