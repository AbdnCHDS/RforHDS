```

Dimitra Blana and Jess Butler, Dec 2019

Based on online material from Amy Willis, Kiirsti Owen and Amelia McNamara, and the book "R for Data Science" by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. The "R for Data Science" book is available for free online: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/

**Workshop objective**: To give you the confidence to find out how to do data analysis in R

**Specific aims**: Learn how to

1. load data
2. transform and summarise data
3. make plots


### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 


### R Studio Layout

**Bottom left**: "Console" window. This is where you interact with R - type a command and press Enter, and you will see the results. When you close R studio, anything you type in the Console is forgotten. For code you want to run again, use the "Source" window.

**Top left**: "Source" window. This is where you type your code and save it as an R script file (like this one), so you can run is as many times as you like.

**Top right**: "Environment" window. This shows you the list of all data you have currently available.

**Bottom right**: This is where your plots will be displayed. Under the "packages" tab it shows the packagers currently installed and loaded (more on that below). The "Help" tab is also quite handy!


### R as a calculator

In the Console window below, type: 2+2 and press Enter
Also try:

```{r}
2^5
3/10
(3+5)^2
sqrt(4)
```

Tip: To run a line (or multiple lines) of code from a script without typing them into the Console, 
select the line(s) you want to run and press Ctrl+Enter (Command+Enter on a Mac)


### Objects

R stores data as objects. You create new objects when you assign a value to them using "<-":

```{r}
x <- 3  # Check the "Environment" window!
```

Tip: use the R studio shortcut Alt+ - (Alt and the minus sign) to easily create the assignment symbol <-

```{r}
y <- 6
x+y
```


Tip: R is case sensitive so if you've defined your object as x, it will not recognise (capital) X. 
Similarly, the function for square root is sqrt, R will give you an error if you try to use Sqrt.


### Packages

Packages extend the functionality of base R. They are distributed via CRAN: the Comprehensive R Archive Network

To install a package, use: install.packages("packagename")
You then need to load it, using library(packagename)

We will be using a collection of packages called the Tidyverse:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


The tidyverse packages we will be using mostly in this workshop are readr (for reading in data), dplyr (for transforming data) and ggplot2 (for plotting). There are many more you can explore later (the book "R for Data Science" mentioned at the top is a good resource).


### Functions

When using the Tidyverse, you can call functions in two ways:

```{r}
sqrt(4) # base R

4 %>%
  sqrt  # "pipe" operator (you can read is as "and then...")
```

Tip: If you are not sure what a function does, type ?functionname in the Console:

```{r}
?sqrt
```


### Working directory

```{r}
getwd()  # What does this function do?
```

--> Set the working directory to the directory where you have stored this R script (and the csv files):

```{r}
# Add your code here!
```


### Reading in data

To read in a comma-separated value (csv) file, use the read_csv function:

```{r}
fev_data <- read_csv("fev.csv")
```

Tip: If you got an error that "fev.csv" does not exist, check that you are working in the correct directory!

--> How would you use read_csv with the pipe operator?

```{r}
# Add your code here!
```

Look at the top few rows of the data:

```{r}
head(fev_data)
```

fev_data is a tibble - this is a tidyverse structure similar to a data frame (from base R) but with some differences:

- default printing is shorter
- tells you the column types (character, double, etc.)
- doesn't change the types of inputs


Tip: if your data is in a Microsoft Excel spreasheet, you will need a different package to read it in, such as readxl. So you'll need:

install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
excel_data <- read_xlsx(filename, sheet = 1) #(to read the first sheet)


--> How would you read in a text file? (Check the cheat sheet!)
There is a text file in your dataset so you can practice: seizure.txt

```{r}
# Add your code here!
```

--> Have a look at the "Useful arguments" section of the cheat sheet. 
Use a few of them when you read in fev.csv and look at the data, is that what you expected?

```{r}
# Add your code here!
```

--> Apply the summary function to a tibble. What does it do?

```{r}
# Add your code here!
```


### Operating on data: columnns

Individual columns are identified using the $ symbol:

```{r}
head(fev_data$fev)
summary(fev_data$fev)
length(fev_data$fev)
```

Other useful functions for tibbles and data frames:

```{r}
names(fev_data)
dim(fev_data)
```

Other useful functions for columns:

```{r}
max(fev_data$fev)
mean(fev_data$fev)
sd(fev_data$fev)
```


### Operating on data: subsets

To select subsets of the data (not just columns with $) use square brackets:

```{r}
fev_data$fev[32] # 32nd element of the fev column

fev_data[32,3] # 32nd element of the 3rd column

fev_data[32,"age"]  # Same thing, but using the name of the 3rd column - better, as it is more readable and robust

fev_data[32, ] # Everything in the 3rd row

fev_data[32,1:3]

fev_data[32,-5]

fev_data[32,-1:-2]

fev_data[32,c(1,3,5)] #c(1,3,5) is a vector of numbers

c(1,3,5) %>%
  length
```

--> How would you drop the 1st, 3rd and 5th column?

```{r}
# Add your code here!
```


### Logicals

Besides numbers and strings of characters, R also stores logicals - TRUE and FALSE

Example: a new vector with elements that are TRUE if height is above 72 cm and FALSE otherwise:

```{r}
is_tall <- fev_data$height > 72
```

Useful summary command:

```{r}
table(is_tall)
```

Which subjects in fev_data are tall?

```{r}
fev_data[is_tall,]
```


### Filtering (selecting rows)

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  filter(height > 72)

fev_data %>%
  filter(age == 6)

fev_data %>%
  filter(age != 20)

fev_data %>%
  filter(age <= 20)
```


You can also filter by whether data are not a number (na):

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  filter(is.na(age))  # opposite: !is.na(age)
```

Rules for filtering for categorical data:
sex == "F" or sex != "F"
sex %in% c("M","F")

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  filter(age == 14, smoke !=0)
```


### Selecting columns

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  select(fev, height, age)


fev_data %>%
  select(-seqnbr, -subjid)
```


### Summarising data

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  filter(age == 14, smoke != 0) %>%
  summarise(mean(fev))
```

You can name the summary variable:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  filter(age == 14, smoke != 0) %>%
  summarise(my_mean = mean(fev))


fev_data %>%
  filter(age == 14, smoke != 0) %>%
  summarise(mean(fev), sd(fev))
```

To get the average FEV for both smokers and non-smokers we don't need to repeat for smoke==0. We can create a grouping variable:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  group_by(smoke)
```
(Same exact data, it just prints the two groups)

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  group_by(smoke) %>%
  summarise(mean(fev), sd(fev))
```

But what is the size of each group? n() gives us the number of observations in each group:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  group_by(smoke) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), mean = mean(fev), sd = sd(fev))
```

You can also group by your own variables:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  group_by(height < 60) %>%
  summarise(n(), mean(fev))
```

A useful function: arrange

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarise(n(), mean(fev)) %>%
  arrange(age) # arrange by increasing age

fev_data %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarise(n(), mean(fev)) %>%
  arrange(desc(age)) # arrange by decreasing age

fev_data$age %>% sort #S ort a column

fev_data$age %>% unique %>% sort # Sort unique values in a column
```

--> **Problem 1**: Which subjects are male and which are female? (i.e. what does sex == 1 mean?)

```{r}
# Add your code here!
```
--> **Problem 2**: Why do smokers appear to have better lung function (higher forced expiratory volume - FEV)?

```{r}
# Add your code here!
```

Useful function: rename

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  rename(ID = subjid)
```

Mutate: compute new column

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  mutate(heightdiff = height - mean(height))
```

Remember that to save these changes you need to assign to a new tibble:

```{r}
new_fev_data <- fev_data %>%
  rename(id = subjid) %>%
  mutate(heightdiff = height - mean(height))
```


### Plotting

The first step to using ggplot is creating a blank canvas:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev))   # aes stands for "aesthetic"
```


### Scatterplots

We add points using geom_point:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev)) +
  geom_point()
```

Add limits, labels, title:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylim(0, 7) +
  ylab("Forced exhalation\nvolume (litres)") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of FEV")
```

We can change the colour of the points (col), the shape of the points (pch) and the size (cex):

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev)) +
  geom_point(cex = 0.5, pch = 18, col = "blue")  # Half as small, filled diamonds, blue
```

Tip: Find out more about ggplot's aesthetic specifications here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/vignettes/ggplot2-specs.html

To colour by sex or smoking status, we add the variables as aesthetic elements:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  mutate(sex = as.character(sex),
         smoke = as.character(smoke)) %>% # change sex and smoke from continuous to categorical variables
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = sex, pch = smoke))
```

Add a smooth line fitted to the data:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  mutate(sex = as.character(sex),
         smoke = as.character(smoke)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = sex, pch = smoke)) +
  geom_smooth()
```

One smooth line per sex:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  mutate(sex = as.character(sex),
         smoke = as.character(smoke)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = sex, pch = smoke)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(col=sex))
```

One smooth line per sex or smoking status:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  mutate(sex = as.character(sex),
         smoke = as.character(smoke)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = sex, pch = smoke)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(col=sex, pch = smoke))

```

or:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  mutate(sex = as.character(sex),
         smoke = as.character(smoke)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev, col = sex, pch = smoke)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```


### Line plots

```{r}
fev_average <- fev_data %>%
  group_by(age, smoke) %>%
  summarise(fev_mean = mean(fev))
```

This is not quite right:

```{r}
fev_average %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev_mean)) +
  geom_line(aes(col = smoke))  # smoke is a continuous numeric variable!
```

This is better :)

```{r}
fev_average %>%
  mutate(smoke = as.character(smoke)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev_mean)) +
  geom_line(aes(col = smoke))
```


### Bar plots

How many subjects smoke?

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  mutate(smoke = as.character(smoke)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = smoke)) + 
  geom_bar()  # by default, the y variable is the count of the x (in this case, number of smokers)

```

How many men and how many women smoke / don't smoke?

```{r}
fev_count <- fev_data %>%
  group_by(sex, smoke) %>%
  summarise(smoke_count = n())
```

It might be easier to replace 0 and 1 with meaningful words...

```{r}
fev_count <- fev_data %>%
  mutate(Smoke = ifelse(smoke == 1, "Smoker", "Non-smoker"),
         Sex = ifelse(sex == 1, "Male", "Female")) %>%
  group_by(Sex, Smoke) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

fev_count %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Smoke, y = Count, fill = Sex)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",     # "identity" allows us to specify a y variable, otherwise it is count (as above)
           position = "dodge") +  # Put bars side-by-side instead of stacked
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Spectral")
```

### Box plots

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  filter(age < 18 & age > 9) %>%
  mutate(smoke = as.character(smoke),
         age = as.character(age)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev, col = smoke)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_bw()
```


### Saving plots

```{r}
ggsave("age_vs_fev.pdf")
```

To change the size:

```{r}
ggsave("age_vs_fev.pdf", width=10, height=5)
```


### Case Study: Hip replacement outcomes for men and women in England

You have a csv file with patient reported outcomes in England (Hip Replacement CCG 1819.csv). We are interested in looking at gender differences when it comes to hip replacements.
It comes from this NHS Visual Data Challenge: https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/project/nhs-visual-data-challenge
We want to create a compelling data visualisation about gender health differences. **Do you want to help?**

You are welcome to look at any outcome you like in the csv file, here are some suggestions:

1. How do the numbers of hip replacement procedures compare between men and women?
2. Compare pre- and post-operative 'EQ-5D Index' scores for men and women
3. Do patient reported outcomes correlate (visually) with conditions such as stroke, lung disease or diabetes?

```{r}
# Add your code here!
```
